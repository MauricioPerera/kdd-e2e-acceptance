# Validate deterministic browser evidence

## Intent
Follow the [integration architecture](../architecture.md) and its trust boundary.

## Interface
validateReport(report, expected) -> run evidence

## Invariants
- Observed results must satisfy the reviewed acceptance criteria.
- Tests and their imported helpers must remain protected by the quality policy.

## Examples
- Correct behavior passes the declared command.
- A changed outcome is rejected by its relevant assertion.

## Do / Don't
- DO: use deterministic assertions and retain actual evidence.
- DON'T: infer approval from a test hash or a green local process.

## Tests
The declared oracle was written before implementation. Complementary adversarial
checks and dependency protection are part of the project quality policy.

## Constraints
PARAR y reportar si implementation requires changing the protected oracle.
This initial profile uses structural budgets; no complexity measurement is claimed.
